Good Evening,

Please find my progress report.

Week 13 (10-01-2022 to 14-01-2022) -
•Trained integrated CycleGAN with 150, 300 and 500 epochs with different hyperparameters. Accurate dust images are generated in 300 epoch range.
•Using pretrained weights of model trained previously with open source CycleGAN with toolkit to improve quality of the images further.

Thanks & Regards,

Title : Progress Report of Week 5

 

Good Evening,

Please find my progress report.

Week 5 (15-11-2021 to 19-11-2021) -
•Integration of FID Score. 
•Optimizing the FID and Inception Score to use same model.
•Improvements in performance of Inception Score. Methods are implemented to obtain a batched version of the activations which has the advantage to reduce memory requirements, at the cost of slightly reduced efficiency.
•KT on exe generation.
•Sanity Testing.

Title : Progess Report of Week 1 and Week 2

 

Good evening,
Please find my progress report-

 

Week 1 (18-10-2021 to 22-10-2021) -
•DNN, CNN from YouTube and from a book - AI and Machine Learning for Coders by Laurence Moroney
•Did problems related to understanding of fundamentals on CNN given by mentor and also gotten many doubts clarified related to CNN and DNN.
•Transfer Learning and Different Metrics.
•Tensorflow. 

Week 2 (25-10-2021 to 29-10-2021) -
•GANS - StyleGan, StarGan.
•Coursera – Generative Adversal Network Speicialization – DeepLearning.ai (Ongoing) 
•SEM AI-Frontier Tool Installation, Environment setup. Explored the tool and also did some projects using custom prepared dataset.
•Built an image converter that can convert from any image format to any other image format. Example .tif to .jpeg format which was required. This is done without storing the images while conversion using BytesIO, glob, Pillow and OpenCV. Also made a directory upload and individual image object upload. Still testing needs to be done to implement to the actual use case. (In progress).

 

Thanks & Regards,

P S Raghotham Rao
